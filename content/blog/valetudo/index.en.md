I want to talk about Valetudo, an open-source firmware for vacuum robots. Many of these devices come equipped with network sniffers that send collected data to servers in China. Valetudo aims to prevent this, which is why Iâ€™m glad this project exists.

I recently purchased a Dreamy Bot L10 Pro and followed the installation guide found [here](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/dreame.html#uart).

Hereâ€™s an image of the installation process:

Another cool software is an [extension](https://github.com/Hypfer/lovelace-valetudo-map-card) for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). This extension allows you to display the maps generated during cleaning, send control commands, and monitor the charging status as well as battery consumption.
