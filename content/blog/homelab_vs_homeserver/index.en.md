# Overview of Home Server and Home Lab

In this blog post, I would like to give you a brief overview of what is behind the terms home server and home lab.

## The Home Server 🏠🖥️

A home server is a device that you can use to store and access your data from home instead of storing it in the cloud.
It can be a computer or a hardware network-attached storage (NAS). One of the most common problems is probably the storage and availability of data.

### Summary

- Typically, it's one computer 🖥️
- Limited services 🖨️💾🎬
- Runs productively 🏋

## The Home Lab 🏠🔬🧪

A home lab is a safe environment where you can experiment with new tools and test procedures.
It typically consists of several computers, network components (such as switches, routers, and patch panels), and a variety of different services.
It is often used to try out new tools and test procedures.

### Summary

- Several computers 🖥️🖥️
- Many different services
- Does not run productively or encapsulated 🚧
- Often with extra network components 🕸️

## My Setup

I run a few VMs and containers and have also installed a few network components and a backup system.
Although I don't like to call it a home lab, my setup probably fits the description.

Here are some of the services I run on my home server:

- Version control system
- Cloud instance
- Documentation
- VPN
- Configuration management
- Home automation

In future blog posts, I will show you how my home server is built, including the hardware, software, backup system, and security measures I have put in place.
