Hello, I'm Sebastian, a computer scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
and a vocational training as an IT specialist for system integration.
I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science.

### My Master's Studies

I am currently pursuing my master's degree at 
[Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-brandenburg.de/startseite/), 
where I also completed my bachelor's degree.

##### Projects During My Master's Studies

- Full-Stack Web Application: EventTom (1st Semester)
    EventTom is a web application for managing and selling event tickets. It was developed as part of the Software Architecture and Quality Assurance course using **FastAPI** and **Vue**.
- Deployment of EventTom (1st Semester)
    In the Cloud Computing ‚Äì Development and Operations course, I worked on automating the deployment of EventTom using Terraform and GitHub Actions on AWS.
- Clustering of Malware (2nd Semester)
    A method was examined that clusters malware into families. The opcode of the malware was transformed into vectors using an embedding language model and stored in a vector database (**Weaviate**). Based on this data, simple clusters could be formed.

##### Digital Forensics

In the IT and Media Forensics course, I gained insights into forensic investigation methods.
Key topics included:
  - Network analysis with **Wireshark**
  - Storage media analysis using **Autopsy** and **Volatility**
  - Introduction to **Reverse Engineering**

##### Media Security

As part of the Media Security course, I explored various techniques for analyzing and securing digital media. This included detecting steganography in images, implementing and identifying digital watermarks (watermarking), and applying perceptual hashing for the robust identification of visual content. Additionally, fundamental biometric methods were covered, particularly those used for authentication based on physiological characteristics.


### My Bachelor's Degree

I completed my Bachelor's degree at the [Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-brandenburg.de/startseite/), where I gained a solid understanding of various core areas of computer science, including logic, algorithms and data structures, databases, and programming.
The focus was on programming languages such as **Java**, **JavaScript**, **C**, and **ARM Assembler**.

##### Projects completed during my studies:

- Password Security (1st semester): In a project, my group created a [presentation](https://passwortunsicherheit.hackwiki.de/) on the topic of password security.
- TODO Web-App (2nd semester): Together with a fellow student, I developed a [TODO web application](https://github.com/53845714nF/OSWC-Semesteraufgabe) as a CGI script.
- Reverse Engineering (3rd semester): Along with fellow students, I analyzed the [communication of a KVM switch](https://github.com/53845714nF/Reverse_Engineering_KVM_Switch).
- Format String Attacks (3rd semester): In the course "Security Basics," I gave a [presentation](https://fsv.hackwiki.de) on format string attacks.
- Image Management Web-App (3rd semester): As part of the course "Cloud Computing," I created a [web app for image management](https://github.com/53845714nF/dockerize_bottletube) on **AWS** using **Python**, **Boto3**, and **Bottle**.
- Cloud Computing with Terraform (3rd semester): I used Terraform in the "Cloud Computing" course to automate my [tasks](https://github.com/53845714nF/Cloud_computing_basics).
- Quiz Web-App (4th semester): Development of a [quiz web application](https://github.com/53845714nF/TypeQuiz) using **TypeScript** and **React**, leveraging **Material-UI** and **Jest**.
- 2D Space Shooter (4th semester): Programming of a [2D space shooter game](https://github.com/53845714nF/excellent_space_shooter) in **Python** using the **Pygame** library.
- Beer Database (4th semester): Creation of a [beer database](https://github.com/53845714nF/Best_Beers) with **Django** and **Python**.
- Image Search Site (4th semester): Development of an image search site using the vector database **Weaviate** and **Flask** in a group project.
- Fictional Webshop (5th semester): Development of a fictional webshop using **Spring** and **React** in another group project.
- 2D Puzzle Game (5th semester): Together with a fellow student, we developed a 2D top-down puzzle game using the **Godot Engine**.
- Solar Panel Utilization Web-App (5th semester): In another group project, we developed a web application to optimize the use of solar panels, using **Flask**, **Golang**, **Keycloak**, **PVGIS**, and **Next.js**.

Many of these projects used **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** for automation.


##### Network Security:

In the 5th semester, I took the elective course "Network Security," where I delved deeply into network attacks and defense mechanisms. The covered attack techniques included MAC flooding, MAC spoofing, ARP spoofing, DHCP starvation, DNS spoofing, and attacks on WiFi networks.
I also learned how to set up a **RADIUS** server, use **firewalls**, and manage logs with **Loki**.
I gained practical experience with the intrusion detection system (IDS) **Snort** and the SIEM system **Wazuh**.

##### Internship:

I completed my internship at [KDAB](https://www.kdab.com/), a company specializing in consulting and development for **C++** and **Qt** applications. 
Here, I worked on further developing the GUI test framework [Spix](https://github.com/53845714nF/spix) and deepened my knowledge in the area of software testing.

##### Bachelor's Thesis:

In my bachelor's thesis, I compared static vulnerability scanners for OCI-based container images using a self-developed web application.
The [application](https://github.com/53845714nF/MarketMinder) consisted of a **Flask** backend (with flask-restful, flask-sqlalchemy, and flask-migrate) and a **React** frontend in **TypeScript** (using Material-UI and react-query).
Using this application, the following scanners were compared: Trivy, Clair, Grype, Snyk, Threat Mapper, Veinmind-tools, OpenSCAP, Dagda, Docker Scout, and Vesta. The results of the scanners were then evaluated using **Python** and **Matplotlib**. ([To the evaluation code](https://github.com/53845714nF/analysis_market_minder)).
The thesis is available at: [https://doi.org/10.25933/opus4-3202](https://doi.org/10.25933/opus4-3202)

### My Vocational Training

I completed my training as an IT specialist in system integration at the [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/), where I specialized in Linux system administration.

In my first week, I replicated an [Arduino project](https://github.com/marcofischer/arduino-zabbix-agent) that monitored server room temperatures and transmitted the data to **Zabbix**, a monitoring system. I later presented this project at an internal technical conference.

During my first year, I worked on an apprentice project focused on application availability. I implemented **HAProxy** as a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple **Apache** web servers. To ensure high availability for the **MySQL** database, I used **Corosync** and **Pacemaker**.
Additionally, I explored network-based storage solutions, comparing **NFS**, **iSCSI**, and **Fibre Channel**, and studied various file systems, including **ZFS**, **Btrfs**, and **Bcachefs**.

In my second year, I gave my first lightning talk on **Bcachefs**, which unexpectedly led to my first [podcast interview](https://www.radiotux.de/index.php?/archives/2019/09.html) (only available in German) with RadioTux.
I also attended training sessions on **Graylog**, a centralized log management tool, and **Bareos**, an open-source backup solution.
Alongside my administrative tasks, I gained insights into web development using **PHP** and the **Symfony** framework.
My vocational school studies also covered **SQL** and **Java**.

My regular responsibilities included network management (**VLAN**, **LAG**), **LDAP** and **DNS** administration, as well as automating tasks with **Bash** and **Python** scripts.

At the end of my second year, I taught myself **SaltStack** to manage configurations centrally. I versioned Salt states using **Git** and implemented a CI pipeline in **GitLab** to automatically test and run them in a test environment.
This was also my first exposure to **Docker**.

In my third year, I introduced the **Greenbone** vulnerability management tool and used **Jira** for project management.

For my final project, I focused on migrating from **VMware** to **Proxmox VE**.

### My School Time

During my school years, I developed simple GUI applications using **Delphi** in computer science classes.

I also created a website for a [fictional web agency](https://think.hackwiki.de/) using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of an elective on web development.
