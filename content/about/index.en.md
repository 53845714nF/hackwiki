Hello, I'm Sebastian, a computer scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
and a vocational training as an IT specialist for system integration.
I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science.

### My Bachelor's Degree

I completed my Bachelor's degree at the [Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.th-brandenburg.de/startseite/), where I gained a solid understanding of various core areas of computer science, including logic, algorithms and data structures, databases, and programming.
The focus was on programming languages such as **Java**, **JavaScript**, **C**, and **ARM Assembler**.

##### Projects completed during my studies:

- Password Security (1st semester): In a project, my group created a [presentation](https://passwortunsicherheit.hackwiki.de/) on the topic of password security.
- TODO Web-App (2nd semester): Together with a fellow student, I developed a [TODO web application](https://github.com/53845714nF/OSWC-Semesteraufgabe) as a CGI script.
- Reverse Engineering (3rd semester): Along with fellow students, I analyzed the [communication of a KVM switch](https://github.com/53845714nF/Reverse_Engineering_KVM_Switch).
- Format String Attacks (3rd semester): In the course "Security Basics," I gave a [presentation](https://fsv.hackwiki.de) on format string attacks.
- Image Management Web-App (3rd semester): As part of the course "Cloud Computing," I created a [web app for image management](https://github.com/53845714nF/dockerize_bottletube) on **AWS** using **Python**, **Boto3**, and **Bottle**.
- Cloud Computing with Terraform (3rd semester): I used Terraform in the "Cloud Computing" course to automate my [tasks](https://github.com/53845714nF/Cloud_computing_basics).
- Quiz Web-App (4th semester): Development of a [quiz web application](https://github.com/53845714nF/TypeQuiz) using **TypeScript** and **React**, leveraging **Material-UI** and **Jest**.
- 2D Space Shooter (4th semester): Programming of a [2D space shooter game](https://github.com/53845714nF/excellent_space_shooter) in **Python** using the **Pygame** library.
- Beer Database (4th semester): Creation of a [beer database](https://github.com/53845714nF/Best_Beers) with **Django** and **Python**.
- Image Search Site (4th semester): Development of an image search site using the vector database **Weaviate** and **Flask** in a group project.
- Fictional Webshop (5th semester): Development of a fictional webshop using **Spring** and **React** in another group project.
- 2D Puzzle Game (5th semester): Together with a fellow student, we developed a 2D top-down puzzle game using the **Godot Engine**.
- Solar Panel Utilization Web-App (5th semester): In another group project, we developed a web application to optimize the use of solar panels, using **Flask**, **Golang**, **Keycloak**, **PVGIS**, and **Next.js**.

Many of these projects used **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** for automation.


##### Network Security:

In the 5th semester, I took the elective course "Network Security," where I delved deeply into network attacks and defense mechanisms. The covered attack techniques included MAC flooding, MAC spoofing, ARP spoofing, DHCP starvation, DNS spoofing, and attacks on WiFi networks.
I also learned how to set up a **RADIUS** server, use **firewalls**, and manage logs with **Loki**.
I gained practical experience with the intrusion detection system (IDS) **Snort** and the SIEM system **Wazuh**.

##### Internship:

I completed my internship at [KDAB](https://www.kdab.com/), a company specializing in consulting and development for **C++** and **Qt** applications. 
Here, I worked on further developing the GUI test framework [Spix](https://github.com/53845714nF/spix) and deepened my knowledge in the area of software testing.

##### Bachelor's Thesis:

In my bachelor's thesis, I compared static vulnerability scanners for OCI-based container images using a self-developed web application.
The [application](https://github.com/53845714nF/MarketMinder) consisted of a **Flask** backend (with flask-restful, flask-sqlalchemy, and flask-migrate) and a **React** frontend in **TypeScript** (using Material-UI and react-query).
Using this application, the following scanners were compared: Trivy, Clair, Grype, Snyk, Threat Mapper, Veinmind-tools, OpenSCAP, Dagda, Docker Scout, and Vesta. The results of the scanners were then evaluated using **Python** and **Matplotlib**. ([To the evaluation code](https://github.com/53845714nF/analysis_market_minder)).

### My Vocational Training

I completed my vocational training as an IT specialist for system integration at the [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/), where I specialized in Linux system administration.

My responsibilities included network management (**VLAN**, **LAG**), **LDAP**, and **DNS** management. I automated IT infrastructure management using **Saltstack** and implemented a CI pipeline with **GitLab** to test Salt States. I also introduced the vulnerability management tool **Greenbone** and used **Jira** for IT project management. I automated small tasks using **Bash** and **Python** scripts. I also gained some insight into web development using **PHP** and the **Symfony** framework. During my vocational school training, I acquired knowledge in **SQL** and **Java**.

In my final project, I focused on migrating from **VMware** to **Proxmox VE**.

### My School Time

During my school years, I developed simple GUI applications using **Delphi** in computer science classes.

I also created a website for a [fictional web agency](https://think.hackwiki.de/) using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of an elective on web development.


### My Private Projects

- [vuln2pve](https://github.com/53845714nF/vuln2pve), a script that downloads VMs from Vulnhub to Proxmox.
- [packer-proxmox-debian](https://github.com/53845714nF/packer-proxmox-debian), a Packer config that creates a Debian template for Proxmox.
- [hasura-jwt](https://github.com/53845714nF/hasura-jwt), a program that issues JWTs for Hasura.
- [time2boot](https://github.com/53845714nF/time2boot), an Arduino project that starts a computer at a specific time.
