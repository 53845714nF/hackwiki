I'm a passionate open source enthusiast and am interested in making systems, networks and programs secure. 
And to check them for their security. My goal is to always develop and improve myself 🧠🏋️.

- 🌱 At the moment I"m constantly looking for technical challenges.
- 👯 Meet with friends in the [Chaostreff Potsdam](https://www.ccc-p.org/) 🚀 and in the [Brandenburger Linux User Group](https://www.bralug.de/) 🐧.
